# CMU CS Academy Rubik's Cube

For my second to last creative task of my CSB class, I thought it would be a
fun idea to put in the extra effort and create a 3D Rubik's cube. The result
came out to be pretty nice in my opinion, and I worked quite a bit for it, so I
thought it would be cool to archive/share it.
